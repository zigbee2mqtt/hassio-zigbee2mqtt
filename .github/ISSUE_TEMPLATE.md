<!-- READ THIS FIRST:
- This issue tracker is for problems with the zigbee2mqtt add-on, not for problems or bugs with zigbee2mqtt itself.
- If your issue is about a specific zigbee device, it probably belongs in the zigbee2mqtt issue tracker (https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt). Consider posting your issue there first.
- If your issue occurs during after zigbee2mqtt has initialized succesfully, it is less likely to be a problem with the add-on. Consider if your question could be better answered within the zigbee2mqtt repository.
