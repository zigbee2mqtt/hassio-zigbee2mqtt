# Home Assistant Add-on: Zigbee2MQTT Proxy

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/zigbee2mqtt/zigbee2mqtt-proxy-amd64.svg?style=flat-square&logo=docker)](https://cloud.docker.com/u/zigbee2mqtt/repository/docker/dwelch2101/zigbee2mqtt-proxy-amd64)

⚠️ This addon does not contain Zigbee2MQTT ⚠️

This addon acts as a proxy to an external running Zigbee2MQTT instance. 
The sole purpose of this addon is to add a Zigbee2MQTT icon to the sidebar of Home Assistant which will open the frontend of an external running Zigbee2MQTT instance.
