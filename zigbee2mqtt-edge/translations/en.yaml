  watchdog:

      Automatically restart Zigbee2MQTT in case of a soft failure (like 'adapter disconnected').
      Using `default` will use the retry delays 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min.
      Custom delays are also supported, e.g. `5,10,30` will start Zigbee2MQTT with the watchdog's retry delays set to 5min, 10min, 30min.
